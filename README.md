# Algorithm-Engineering Floating Point Filter
## ABOUT
This project is our implementation of the Floating Point Filter problem in the Algorithm Engineering course 2019.
We are Toni MÃ¼ller, Rong Huang and Ksenia Krylova.
## STRUCTURE
Most of the important files can be found under src. The folder data_structure/ contains our implementation of a Point.
The folder algorithm/ contains most of our algorithmic methods.
Tests can be found in test/.
If you have any contributions, please file in an issue.
## DEVELOP
You can import the project as an Eclipse/Idea Project.
After that make sure src/ and test/ are in the buildpath.
For testing we require the JUNIT Library (I used JUNIT 5).
